"""
Pre-compaction memory flush.

Long-running agents lose granular facts at the context cliff: the host
framework summarizes old turns and whatever the summary drops is gone. The
harness flushes durable facts into governed memory BEFORE that happens, tagged
``_flush: "pre_compaction"`` so the audit chain shows when the agent
externalized what it knew.
