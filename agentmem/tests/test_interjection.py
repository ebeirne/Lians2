"""
Interjection extraction — sub-turn durable facts (the agent_sim finding).

Two layers under test:
  1. The deterministic clause extractor (pure) — pulls buried durable facts
     ("remind me I eat fish now" mid-task) out of long conversational turns,
     and stays silent on single-clause turns, task chatter, and keyed facts.
  2. The ranking helpers — parent/clause collapse (one fact can't fill two
     result slots) and the time-aware stale-clause demotion.
