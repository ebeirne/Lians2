"""
Regulated memory eval — the benchmark only a compliance-grade memory layer passes.

General memory benchmarks (LoCoMo, LongMemEval) measure conversational recall. They
do not measure the things a regulated buyer must guarantee, and an accumulate-
everything store *fails* them by design:

  1. stale-revision suppression   — a superseded fact must NOT be retrieved
  2. point-in-time reconstruction — recall as-of a past date returns what was known then
  3. erasure proof                — erased content is unrecoverable
  4. lookahead-contamination      — facts unknowable at the simulation date are flagged
  5. audit state reconstruction   — the full knowledge state at any past T is reproducible

Each check is a hard invariant (pass/fail), run against any Lians client. Run the
*same* harness against mem0 / Zep adapters and watch them fail items 1, 3, and 4.
