"""
Graphiti OSS live adapter — runs getzep/graphiti in its default documented
configuration (OpenAI LLM + embeddings + reranker) on an embedded Kuzu graph,
so the Zep/Graphiti column can be *executed*, not capability-assessed.

Requirements to go live (all from Graphiti's own quickstart):
    pip install graphiti-core kuzu
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...

Fairness notes:
- This is Graphiti exactly as its README configures it — default clients,
  default search. We do not swap in weaker local models for the extraction
  step its invalidation logic depends on.
- Primitives Graphiti does not expose as turnkey APIs (as-of recall, erasure
  certificate, backtest guard, audit snapshot) raise CapabilityAbsent; the
  comparison layer then keeps the *documented* capability credit (e.g. the
  PARTIAL for temporal edge filtering) rather than letting a live run zero
  a cell for the same reason the static map already discounted it.
