"""
Hindsight (vectorize-io) adapter for the regulated-eval harness.

Hindsight is "agent memory that learns": retain / recall / reflect over a
per-agent memory bank. retain() accepts an event timestamp; recall() runs four
retrieval strategies in parallel (semantic, BM25, entity-graph, temporal
time-range filtering); reflect() revises observations and mental models, with
history preserved ("updated — not overwritten"). It is the strongest of the
dev-memory lane on temporal awareness, and is credited as such. What it does
NOT provide is the compliance layer: no as-of knowledge-state recall (temporal
filtering scopes *event* time ranges, not what-was-believed-at-T), **no delete
or forget API at all**, no erasure certificate, no lookahead guard, and no
audit snapshot.

Capability map (each cell justified against the public API):

  stale_revision_suppression   PARTIAL  reflect() revises observations when new
                                        evidence contradicts them and recall
                                        prefers current beliefs — but it is
                                        LLM-reflection-driven, not a keyed
                                        deterministic supersession; raw retained
                                        memories still accumulate.
  point_in_time_reconstruction PARTIAL  retain() stamps event timestamps and the
                                        temporal strategy answers time-range
                                        queries ("what happened in June") — but
                                        there is no as-of primitive returning
                                        the knowledge state as believed at T.
  erasure_proof                ABSENT   no delete / forget / erase API exists on
                                        the public surface; a bank cannot prove
                                        content unrecoverable.
  lookahead_contamination      ABSENT   no backtest / lookahead primitive.
  audit_state_reconstruction   ABSENT   history is preserved internally but no
                                        snapshot or audit-state API exposes it.
