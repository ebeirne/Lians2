Regulated-memory eval — head-to-head comparison renderer.

Runs the regulated-eval harness LIVE against Lians and renders a comparison table
against mem0, Zep, Letta, Hindsight, and Supermemory. Lians results are *executed*.
Competitor cells are a capability assessment derived from each product's public API
surface (see benchmarks/adapters/*_adapter.py); with that product's SDK + key
present, its column is executed live instead.

    python -m benchmarks.compare_regulated            # print table
    python -m benchmarks.compare_regulated --write    # also write docs/regulated-eval-results.md

Scoring: pass = 1.0, partial = 0.5, absent/fail = 0.0.

## Appendix — live-run findings (2026-07-04, mem0 2.0.11, graphiti-core 0.29.2)

Executed configurations: **mem0 OSS** `Memory.from_config({"llm": {"provider":
"openai", "config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}}})` — default everything else;
**Graphiti OSS** default OpenAI clients on an embedded Kuzu database.

Per-cell behavioral evidence (stale-revision pair: "Moody's credit rating for
ACME Corp is Baa2" → "Moody's upgraded ACME Corp's credit rating to Baa1"):

- **mem0**: stored and returned *both* revisions ("credit rating is Baa2" and
  "upgraded to Baa1" side by side in search results) with no marking on the
  stale one → fail. `delete_all()` made erased content unretrievable but
  emits no proof artifact → partial. As-of recall: mem0 2.x's `timestamp` /
  `reference_date` parameters are documented by mem0 itself as "Platform-only
  temporal parameter. Not supported in OSS" → absent in the self-hosted product.
- **Graphiti**: its contradiction invalidation **worked** — both stale edges
  received `invalid_at = 2025-11-01`, correctly backdated to the revision's
  reference time (genuinely good engineering, credited). But default search
  **returns invalidated edges**: an agent assembling context from Graphiti's
  retrieval gets "ACME is rated Baa2" back unless the caller filters
  `invalid_at` manually → partial (capability present, suppression not
  turnkey). `remove_episode` deleted the episode and its derived edges
  behaviorally → partial (no proof artifact).

Upstream defects found while executing the vendors' own quickstart paths
(each required an accommodation to avoid scoring an unearned zero; all are
worth upstream reports):

1. **mem0 2.0.11**: the default OpenAI model rejects mem0's own default
   `temperature=0.1` ("Unsupported value ... Only the default (1) value is
   supported"), so every default-config `add()` fails LLM extraction and
   stores nothing. Accommodation: pin `gpt-4o-mini` (the model mem0's docs
   use), which accepts their default temperature.
2. **graphiti-core 0.29.2 (Kuzu)**: passing any `group_id` to `add_episode`
   crashes — it reads `driver._database`, which `KuzuDriver.__init__` never
   sets. Accommodation: use the provider's default group.
3. **graphiti-core 0.29.2 (Kuzu)**: `build_indices_and_constraints()` is a
   no-op and `setup_schema()` creates no FTS indexes, but default search
   issues `QUERY_FTS_INDEX` — search crashes out of the box. Accommodation:
   run graphiti's own `get_fulltext_indices(KUZU)` statements at setup.

_Generated by `python -m benchmarks.compare_regulated --write` on {ts}._

General memory benchmarks (LoCoMo, LongMemEval) measure conversational recall. They
do **not** measure what a regulated buyer must guarantee. This eval scores five hard
invariants that an accumulate-everything store fails *by design*. Each is a turnkey
primitive: either the product has an API that satisfies it, or it does not.

{table}

**Run status:** {exec_note}.

## What each invariant means

1. **Stale revision suppressed** — after a fact is revised, the superseded value must
   not be retrieved. Lians does this with deterministic keyed supersession; competitors
   attempt it via LLM/graph/reflection invalidation (non-deterministic, extraction-dependent).
2. **Point-in-time (as-of) recall** — recall *as it was known* on a past date. Requires
   a bitemporal model with an as-of query primitive.
3. **Provable erasure** — erased content is cryptographically unrecoverable and the
   system emits an erasure certificate (GDPR Art. 17 / HIPAA). Deleting a row is not
   the same as proving it is gone.
4. **Lookahead / backtest guard** — facts unknowable at a simulation date are flagged,
   so a backtest or model isn't contaminated by future information.
5. **Audit-state snapshot at T** — the full knowledge state at any past time is
   reproducible for an examiner.

A sixth invariant — **barrier-group (Chinese-wall) leakage** — is verified separately
against PostgreSQL Row-Level Security with a non-superuser role
(`agentmem/tests/test_pgvector.py`), because it is a database-layer guarantee, not an
application-API call.

## Methodology & honesty notes

- **Lians is executed live** by this script against `LocalLiansClient` (the same
  bitemporal/audit engine as the server). Its score is a real test run, not a claim.
- **Competitor columns execute live when credentials permit.** With
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, the mem0 column runs **mem0 OSS in its default
  documented configuration** (`Memory()`, OpenAI LLM + embeddings) and the
  Zep/Graphiti column runs **Graphiti OSS in its default configuration**
  (OpenAI LLM/embeddings/reranker, embedded Kuzu) — the self-hosted
  deployments a regulated buyer would actually evaluate, configured exactly
  as their own quickstarts configure them. Remaining columns are scored from
  documented capabilities encoded in `benchmarks/adapters/*_adapter.py`,
  with a one-line justification per cell.
- **Live merges are fair in both directions.** A check that *runs* gets its
  live result — better or worse than the documented score. A check that
  raises `CapabilityAbsent` ("no turnkey API") carries no new behavioral
  evidence, so the documented credit (e.g. Graphiti's partial for temporal
  edge filtering) is preserved — a live run never zeroes a cell for the same
  reason the static map already discounted it.
- **A full erasure pass requires the proof artifact.** Behavioral deletion
  (content stops being retrievable) scores *partial*; *pass* additionally
  requires an erasure certificate / request reference. This applies to Lians
  and competitors identically.
- **mem0's temporal parameters are Platform-only.** mem0 2.x exposes
  `timestamp` and `reference_date` in its SDK signatures, but its own
  docstrings mark them "Platform-only temporal parameter. Not supported in
  OSS" — the OSS as-of cell reflects that, per mem0's documentation.
- **Anyone can re-run any column.** Install the competitor SDK, export the
  relevant key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` for the OSS columns; `MEM0_API_KEY` /
  `ZEP_API_KEY` / `LETTA_API_KEY` / `HINDSIGHT_API_URL` /
  `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY` for hosted APIs), and re-run — the adapter switches
  from the static capability map to live execution and overwrites that column.
- **Competitors are credited where they're strong.** Zep's bitemporal graph earns
  partials on temporal recall and stale-edge invalidation; mem0's LLM fact management
  earns a partial on supersession; Letta's agent-driven memory edits earn a partial on
  supersession; Hindsight's timestamped retain + temporal retrieval earns a partial on
  point-in-time recall and its belief revision a partial on supersession; Supermemory's
  profile consolidation earns a partial on supersession. This is not a strawman — the
  gaps are the compliance primitives (provable erasure, lookahead guard, audit
  snapshot) that the dev-memory, agent-memory, and temporal-graph lanes were never
  built to provide. Hindsight is the only column with **no deletion API at all**, so
  its erasure cell is absent rather than partial.
