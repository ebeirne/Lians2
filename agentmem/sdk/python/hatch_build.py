"""
Wheel build hook: vendor the Lians service engine as ``lians_engine``.

The engine source lives in one of two places depending on what we're
building from:

- **repo checkout** — ``../../src/lians`` relative to this file (the sdk dir)
- **unpacked sdist** — ``lians_engine/lians`` inside the project root (the
  sdist's own force-include put it there, because ``../../`` doesn't exist
  in an sdist)

A static ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` can only name one
path, and `python -m build` builds the wheel *from the sdist* — which is how
the 0.3.3 release pipeline failed with "Forced include not found". This hook
picks whichever source exists at build time.
