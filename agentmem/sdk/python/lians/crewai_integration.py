"""
CrewAI integration for Lians.

Provides BaseTool subclasses compatible with crewai >= 0.28.

Install::

    pip install lians[crewai]

Usage::

    from lians import LocalLiansClient
    from lians.crewai_integration import build_crewai_tools

    client = LocalLiansClient()
    tools = build_crewai_tools(client, agent_id="research-agent")

    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    analyst = Agent(
        role="Financial Analyst",
        goal="Analyse NVDA earnings and recall prior guidance",
        tools=tools,
        llm=my_llm,
    )

Four tools are returned:

- ``remember_fact``   — store a financial fact with its event timestamp
- ``recall_facts``    — retrieve current memories by semantic search
- ``recall_facts_at`` — retrieve memories valid at a specific past date (compliance)
- ``flush_memory``    — batch-persist durable facts before context compaction

The ``recall_facts_at`` tool queries memories as they were at a specific past date.
mem0 has no bitemporal model. Graphiti/Zep has temporal graph queries but no
compliance audit stack (hash chain, crypto-shred, information barriers), so
CrewAI agents backed by Lians get both point-in-time accuracy and SEC/FINRA-grade auditability.
