"""
OpenAI Agents SDK integration for Lians.

Provides FunctionTool wrappers for the OpenAI Agents SDK (openai-agents >= 0.1).
Works with any Lians client (LocalLiansClient for dev, LiansClient for
production).

Install::

    pip install lians[openai-agents]
    # or: pip install openai-agents

Usage::

    from openai_agents import Agent, Runner
    from lians import LocalLiansClient
    from lians.openai_agents_integration import build_openai_agent_tools

    client = LocalLiansClient()
    tools  = build_openai_agent_tools(client, agent_id="equity-desk")

    agent = Agent(
        name="Equity Analyst",
        instructions="You are an equity research analyst with persistent memory.",
        tools=tools,
    )
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "What guidance did NVDA give last quarter?")

Four tools are returned:

- ``agentmem_remember``       — store a fact with its event timestamp and metadata
- ``agentmem_recall``         — retrieve current facts by semantic search
- ``agentmem_recall_at``      — retrieve facts valid at a specific past date (compliance)
- ``agentmem_flush``          — batch-persist durable facts before context compaction

The ``agentmem_recall_at`` tool is the compliance differentiator:
it answers "what did the model know before the trade?" with a verifiable,
tamper-evident hash chain — no other memory store in the OpenAI ecosystem provides this.

    agent_id:
        The agent namespace to read/write memories under.

        Store a fact or observation in Lians persistent memory.

        Always use event_time_iso for when the event *occurred*, not when you are
        recording it. Add ticker/metric metadata when storing financial facts to
        enable precision recall later. Example event_time_iso: '2026-05-10T00:00:00Z'
        for an earnings call on May 10.

        The memory is stored with AES-256-GCM encryption and written to a SHA-256
        tamper-evident audit chain (SEC 17a-4 compliant). If a newer value for the
        same entity+attribute already exists, this fact will be marked as superseded
        automatically — the agent always recalls the current truth.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content:
            The fact, observation, or decision to remember.
        event_time_iso:
            ISO 8601 timestamp for when the real-world event occurred.
        metadata_json:
            JSON string of metadata tags. Useful keys: ticker, metric, entity,
            source, sector. Example: '{"ticker": "NVDA", "metric": "guidance"}'
        importance:
            Salience score 0.0–1.0. Default 0.5. Use 0.8–1.0 for high-impact
            regulatory or market-moving facts.

        Superseded facts are excluded at the database layer — only the latest

        on stored financial or factual data to avoid hallucinating stale figures.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query:
            Natural-language question describing what to retrieve.

        Use for compliance and audit queries: "What guidance did we have on
        2026-03-01?" or "What was the consensus before the revision?"

        This is the compliance differentiator: it returns the exact fact set that
        was valid at the given timestamp, accounting for out-of-order ingestion.
        mem0 has no bitemporal model. Graphiti/Zep has temporal graph queries but
        no hash-chain audit stack — there is no verifiable proof that the result

        Persist a batch of durable facts NOW, before context compaction.

        Call this when the conversation is about to be summarized or truncated

        not written here may be lost when older turns are compacted away.
        Review the conversation and extract the facts worth keeping: decisions
        made, constraints learned, client instructions, corrections, and
        commitments — not chit-chat.

        Each write is tagged as a pre-compaction flush in the tamper-evident
