## 1. Mem0

**To:** (verify — founders@mem0.ai / GitHub) · **Subject:** `Fact-check request: how we scored mem0 in an open compliance benchmark`

> Hi Mem0 team,
>
> I'm Ethan, the author of Lians — an open-source agent-memory layer aimed at
> regulated deployments (finance/healthcare/legal). Honest context first: your
> ecosystem is the reason "agent memory" is a category a buyer can search for
> at all — our own comparison docs say so explicitly, and our migration guide
> assumes people start with mem0 for good reasons.
>
> We're publishing an evaluation that scores memory systems on five
> compliance-specific invariants that LoCoMo/LongMemEval don't cover:
> stale-revision suppression, point-in-time (as-of) recall, provable erasure,
> lookahead/backtest guards, and audit-state reconstruction. Lians is scored
> by the same harness, same knife.
>
> Your column was **executed live** — mem0 OSS 2.0.11 in its default
> configuration (OpenAI LLM + embeddings), not scored from docs. Two things
> from that run you should see before anyone else does:
>
> 1. The results, methodology, per-cell evidence, and your column's exact
>    adapter code:
>    https://github.com/Lians-ai/Lians/blob/master/docs/regulated-eval-results.md
>    https://github.com/Lians-ai/Lians/blob/master/agentmem/benchmarks/adapters/mem0_adapter.py
> 2. While setting up the run we hit a bug in the OSS defaults (default model
>    resolves to gpt-5-mini, which rejects the default temperature=0.1, so
>    default-config add() silently stores nothing). We filed it with a repro
>    and workaround: https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/issues/6085 — and pinned
>    gpt-4o-mini in our run so your column wasn't scored on a broken default.
>
> Two asks, both optional:
>
> - If any cell is wrong — an API we missed, a configuration that changes the
>   outcome — tell me and I'll fix it before wider publication and credit the
>   correction to your team by name.
> - If you'd rather run the harness yourselves, the adapter interface is six
>   methods; PRs against your own adapter are welcome and will be merged.
>
> If I don't hear back by **Friday, July 17**, we'll publish with the column
> as-is and a note that you were offered review on July 3. Either way the
> harness stays open and your column stays re-runnable — corrections are
> welcome after publication too.

## 2. Zep

**To:** (verify — founders@getzep.com / GitHub) · **Subject:** `Fact-check request: how we scored Graphiti in an open compliance benchmark`

> Hi Zep team,
>
> I'm Ethan, the author of Lians — an open-source agent-memory layer aimed at
> regulated deployments. Honest context first: Graphiti's bitemporal edge
> model is genuinely good engineering — our own relationship graph credits it
> as the direct inspiration, in our docs, by name.
>
> We're publishing an evaluation that scores memory systems on five
> compliance-specific invariants that LoCoMo/LongMemEval don't cover:
> stale-revision suppression, point-in-time (as-of) recall, provable erasure,
> lookahead/backtest guards, and audit-state reconstruction. Lians is scored
> by the same harness, same knife.
>
> Your column was **executed live** — Graphiti OSS 0.29.2 in its default
> OpenAI configuration on embedded Kuzu — and I want to flag that the run
> *confirmed* your documented strengths rather than discounting them: your
> contradiction invalidation fired and correctly backdated `invalid_at` to
> the revision's reference time, which we credit in print. The gap we scored
> is that default search returns invalidated edges, so suppression isn't
> turnkey for a caller assembling agent context. Results, per-cell evidence,
> and your column's exact adapter code:

>
> While setting up the run we also hit the two Kuzu-driver issues already
> tracked in getzep/graphiti#1258 and confirmed they persist in 0.29.2, with
> repros and complete workarounds:
> https://github.com/getzep/graphiti/issues/1258#issuecomment-4880328136

>   before wider publication and credit the correction to your team by name.
>   I'd particularly value your read on whether we've drawn the line between
>   validity windows and two-axis point-in-time recall fairly.

## 3. Letta

**To:** (verify — contact@letta.com / GitHub) · **Subject:** `Fact-check request: how we scored Letta in an open compliance benchmark`

> Hi Letta team,
>
> I'm Ethan, the author of Lians — an open-source agent-memory layer aimed at
> regulated deployments. The MemGPT lineage is the most original architecture
> in this space, and I want to be upfront that our eval necessarily scores
> *turnkey compliance primitives* rather than agent-managed memory — if that
> framing misrepresents what Letta is for, I'd rather hear it from you than
> from your users after publication.
>
> The eval scores five invariants (stale-revision suppression, point-in-time
> recall, provable erasure, lookahead guards, audit-state reconstruction)
> across six systems, Lians included, same harness for everyone. Your column
> is currently capability-assessed from your public API surface, with a
> one-line justification per cell in the adapter:

## 4. Hindsight

> Hi Hindsight team,
>
> I'm Ethan, the author of Lians — an open-source agent-memory layer aimed at

>
> The one cell I most want checked: **erasure**. As of our review we found no
> deletion API at all, so that cell is scored absent rather than partial — if
> that's wrong or has changed, I'd genuinely rather fix it than publish it.
>
> If any cell is wrong, I'll correct it before wider publication and credit
> your team by name; adapter PRs are welcome. If I don't hear back by
