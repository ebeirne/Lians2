# mem0 Alternative, Fully Self-Hosted (2026)

*Last updated: July 2026. Facts below reflect mem0's public docs and pricing
pages as of this date; corrections welcome via issue or PR.*

**Direct answer:** if you hit the gap between mem0's open-source core and its
cloud tiers — graph memory, advanced retrieval, and the platform features that
sit behind the paid managed product — and you need everything to run inside
your own infrastructure, [Lians](https://github.com/Lians-ai/Lians) is the
Apache-2.0 alternative where **the entire feature set is in the open**: nothing
in the memory engine, the relationship graph, the audit chain, erasure, access
control, or admission control is gated behind a hosted tier. (Lians' managed
cloud has usage tiers like any hosted service — but they gate access to *our
servers*, not the software: every feature in those tiers is in the public
repository and free to self-host.)

## Why teams look for a self-hosted mem0 alternative

mem0 has the largest ecosystem in the category — the most stars, the most
framework integrations, the most tutorials. Teams leave for three specific
reasons:

1. **The open-core line lands in awkward places.** The differentiating
   capabilities (graph memory, the managed platform's retrieval and analytics)
   belong to the paid cloud product. Self-hosting the OSS package gets you a
   vector-store pipeline; the features in the launch blog posts mostly live in
   the cloud tier. For teams whose whole reason to self-host is "the data
   cannot leave," a paywall that only unlocks in SaaS is a dead end.
2. **ADD-only memory accumulates stale facts.** mem0's current model appends
   fact versions; superseded values coexist with current ones and retrieval
   ranks them by relevance. When facts *change* (rates, guidance, doses,
   client status), stale versions leak into context. Lians closes the old
   version at the database layer with deterministic keyed supersession —
   0/4 stale facts in top-5 recall vs 4/4 for a mem0-style accumulate pipeline
   ([benchmark](benchmark.md)).
3. **No compliance spine.** mem0's OSS has `user_id` filtering for access
   control, a delete API without erasure proof, and no audit trail. Fine for
   personalization; not reviewable by a compliance officer.

## Feature-for-feature: what's open where

| Capability | mem0 OSS (self-hosted) | mem0 platform (cloud) | Lians (self-hosted, all open) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core memory add/search | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Graph / relationship memory | ✗ (cloud feature) | ✓ paid tier | ✓ bitemporal edges, N-hop, point-in-time `path` |
| Point-in-time (as-of) recall | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ `recall_at`, `snapshot` |
| Supersession of revised facts | ✗ (versions coexist) | LLM-managed | ✓ deterministic, keyed (100% on the [supersession benchmark](benchmark.md)) |
| Audit trail | ✗ | platform logs | ✓ SHA-256 hash chain, SEC 17a-4 posture, `verify_chain`, WORM mode |
| Right-to-erasure | delete API | delete API | ✓ per-subject crypto-shred + erasure certificate; audit survives |
| Access control | `user_id` filter | platform | ✓ scoped keys, RBAC roles, PostgreSQL RLS barriers (CI-proven) |
| Memory admission control (PII/PHI/injection gate) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ `ADMISSION_MODE` monitor/enforce + review queue |
| Backtest / lookahead guard | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ `backtest_check` ([demo](../demo/lookahead-bias/README.md)) |
| Air-gap deployment | partial (embedder/LLM egress) | ✗ | ✓ `AIRGAP_MODE` with local embeddings |
| SDK languages | Python, TypeScript | + REST | Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, C |
| License of the full feature set | open core | proprietary | **Apache 2.0, everything** |

On the compliance axis specifically, the [regulated-memory eval](regulated-eval-results.md)
scores Lians 5.0/5 vs mem0 OSS 0.5/5 — both **executed live**, mem0 in its
default configuration (OpenAI LLM + embeddings). The live run showed mem0
storing and returning both the current and the superseded revision of a fact
side by side, unmarked; per-cell evidence is in the eval's appendix, and the
harness is open if you want to re-run it.

## What mem0 does better — read this before switching

- **Ecosystem breadth.** ~21 framework integrations, huge community, answers on
  every forum. Lians covers LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK,
  AutoGen, and MCP — the major lanes, but fewer total checkboxes.
- **Personalization focus.** mem0's LLM fact extraction is tuned for
  conversational user memory ("remembers your preferences"). If your workload
  is consumer personalization with no audit/erasure/residency requirements,
  mem0 OSS is simpler and its cloud is convenient.
- **Managed zero-ops.** If SaaS is acceptable, mem0's platform removes ops
  entirely; Lians' managed offering is younger.

## Migration

[Migrate from mem0](migrate-from-mem0.md) — the write path maps directly
(`m.add(messages, user_id=…)` → `mem.add_from_messages(...)`); the main
decision is assigning `event_time` (defaults to ingestion time) and metadata
keys so supersession activates. Both SDKs can run side by side during cutover.

```bash
pip install lians-sdk[local]            # evaluate with zero infrastructure
docker compose up --build               # full server, Postgres + pgvector, ~20 min
```
